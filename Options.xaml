                            <TextBlock Text="Why Smart Filters?" FontSize="24" FontWeight="Bold" />
                            <TextBlock Text="We all face the same dilemma: making the most out of our imaging nights, especially when the weather isn’t always on our side." Margin="0,5,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="Smart Filters was born from this idea: optimize each imaging session to reach the desired distribution between the different filters (L, R, G, B, Ha, OIII, SII), while taking real-world constraints into account." Margin="0,5,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="The problem with classic approaches:" FontWeight="Bold" Margin="0,10,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="The usual method is to assume, for example, that you have 8 hours of imaging time and simply loop through a sequence that cycles several filters, hoping the time will naturally balance itself." Margin="0,5,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="But this comes with several drawbacks:" Margin="0,5,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="• Multiple autofocus runs: each filter change can trigger an autofocus, which wastes precious time." Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="• Offsets aren't always perfect: using filter offsets can save time, but might slightly reduce precision." Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="• No flexibility in sequencing: if the Moon is up early in the night, it's better to start with Ha. You might want to shoot Blue when the target is highest, Red when it’s lower, or OIII when the Moon is farthest." Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="Maybe you’ve already gathered some data from a previous session. You just need to complete the missing layers." Margin="0,10,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="But how many exposures are still needed per filter? How do you plan your session while taking into account:" Margin="0,5,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="• the data already acquired," Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="• the total time available," Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="• meridian flips," Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="• autofocus routines," Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="• dithering (which depends on the number of exposures you haven’t calculated yet…)," Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="• and still stay within your available time window?" Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="The solution: Smart Filters" FontWeight="Bold" Margin="0,10,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="Smart Filters handles the complexity for you." />
                            <TextBlock Text="It takes all of these parameters into account and generates an optimized sequence plan according to your target distribution." Margin="0,5,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="Less guesswork , More efficiency" />

                            <TextBlock Text="3. For each filter, indicate how much exposure time you've already acquired (if any)." Margin="20,2,0,0" />
                            <TextBlock Text="4. Define the target proportion each filter should represent in your final dataset." Margin="20,2,0,0" />

                            <TextBlock Text="6. Set a tolerance percentage to reserve a small buffer of unused time at the end of the night." Margin="20,2,0,0" />
